# CandleScraper
Scraper of OHLC candles from Coin Market Cap web site.

This project demonstrates my code style, familiarity with NoSQL databases and ability to solve such kind of tasks. Also I agree, that retrieving candles (OHLCs) from the website not good approach for real project. Using Web API or high speed sockets is preferable.
